# Project Instructions for AI Assistants

## Repository profile
- Monorepo with Angular 21 + NestJS 11.
- Use `pnpm` commands only.
- Follow issue-driven delivery with one active owner role (`agent:*`).
- Run preflight before coding:
  - `pnpm agent:preflight -- --issue <issue_number> --agent <agent:role>`
- Branch naming must include issue id:
  - `feature/<issue_number>-<slug>`, `fix/<issue_number>-<slug>`, `chore/<issue_number>-<slug>`

## Angular development contract
- Use feature-first structure in `apps/web/src/app/features`.
- Respect layer boundaries: `ui -> state -> data-access`.
- Keep domain models and transport DTOs separated.
- Standardize state with `@ngrx/signals`.
- Keep UI components decoupled from stores and API services.
- Enforce accessible loading/error/empty/success states.

## Required validation
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`
- Complete final self-review gate:
  - `docs/ai/checklists/ai-self-review-gate.md`
  - PR section `AI Self-Review Gate` with framework + decision
